# Containerizing an ASP.NET Core API

This repository contains the code from the [ASP.NET Core with GitOps Series](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sysadmin/containerization/asp-net-core-with-gitops-dockerizing-an-api-on-aws-ec2/).


## The series so far

The README file will be updated as the articles get published.
So far, the series consists of:

1. [Dockerizing an API on AWS EC2](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sysadmin/containerization/asp-net-core-with-gitops-dockerizing-an-api-on-aws-ec2/)

You can use the **master** branch to follow this tutorial, even though it contains more files than necessary. The only ones you are concerned with for now are the **Dockerfile** and the ASP.NET project files.
